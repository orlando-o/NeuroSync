## Model Architecture:

The code implements a Multi-Layer Feedforward Neural Network (MLFN) with one hidden layer. 

**Structure:**

* **Input Layer:** 10 neurons (5 for the force values and 5 for the displacement values)
* **Hidden Layer:** 10 neurons with the 'Tanh' activation function.
* **Output Layer:** 1 neuron to predict the displacement value.

## Hyperparameters:

The following machine learning hyperparameters are extracted from the code:

* **Epochs:** 100000
* **Learning Rate:** 0.1 (dynamically adjusted during training)
* **Optimizer:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* **Step Size Rate:** 1.01 (used to increase the learning rate when loss decreases)
* **Step Back:** 0.4 (used to decrease the learning rate when loss increases)

**Note:** The learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on the loss function's value. If the loss decreases, the learning rate is increased by a factor of 1.01. Conversely, if the loss increases, the learning rate is decreased by a factor of 0.4.
