## Model Architecture:

The code implements a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) with two convolutional layers in the encoder and two transposed convolutional layers in the decoder.

**Structure:**

* **Encoder:**
    * **Layer 1:** 2D Convolution with 16 filters, kernel size 3, stride 2, and padding 1.  
    * **Activation:** ReLU
    * **Layer 2:** 2D Convolution with 4 filters, kernel size 3, stride 2, and padding 1. 
    * **Activation:** ReLU
* **Decoder:**
    * **Layer 1:** 2D Transposed Convolution with 16 filters, kernel size 4, stride 2, and padding 1.
    * **Activation:** ReLU
    * **Layer 2:** 2D Transposed Convolution with 1 filter, kernel size 4, stride 2, and padding 1.
    * **Activation:** Sigmoid

**Note:** This architecture assumes the input is a grayscale image with dimensions 28x28. The encoder downsamples the image through the convolutional layers, extracting features. The decoder then upsamples the encoded features back to the original image size using transposed convolutions.

## Hyperparameters:

The following machine learning hyperparameters are extracted from the code:

* **Batch Size:** 64
* **Learning Rate:** 1e-3
* **Epochs:** 10
* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) 

**Note:** 
* The input images are normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1.
* The code uses the `cuda()` function, indicating the model is trained on a GPU.
* The `torch.save()` function saves the trained model's state dictionary to a file named 'conv_autoencoder.pth'.
