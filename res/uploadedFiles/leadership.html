        How does Extra-Curricular Activities Improve Leadership?
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is often said thatÂ leaders are made, not born. Students who desire to
        do so have room to learn new skills to grow their leadership
        capabilities. Students who participate in extracurriculars graduate with
        more leadership traits and abilities. Often we see such students having
        an edge when tackling new projects, organizing, planning, leading, and
        motivating themselves and others. Leaders should be able to influence
        while communicating and delegating effectively. These skills can be
        acquired/practiced through working with teams.
