Here are the machine learning hyperparameters extracted from the provided code, presented in a readable format:

**Model:**

* **Model Type:** Multilayer Feedforward Network (MLFN)
* **Input Dimension:** 10 (5 for external force values and 5 for displacement values)
* **Hidden Dimension:** 10
* **Output Dimension:** 1 (predicted displacement)
* **Activation Function:** `nn.Tanh()`

**Training:**

* **Optimizer:** `torch.optim.SGD`
* **Learning Rate:** 0.1 (dynamically adjusted during training)
* **Learning Rate Adjustment:**
    * **Step Size Rate:** 1.01 (increases learning rate if loss decreases)
    * **Step Back:** 0.4 (decreases learning rate if loss increases)
* **Loss Function:** `nn.MSELoss()`
* **Epochs:** 100000

**Other:**

* **Device:** 'cpu' (for execution)

**Key Observations:**

* The code uses a Multilayer Feedforward Network with 1 hidden layer and a hyperbolic tangent activation function for the prediction of displacement.
* The learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on the loss trend to optimize the training process.
* The code uses a standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to measure the difference between the predicted and actual displacement values.
* The training runs for 100,000 epochs, which is a significant amount of training time, suggesting a need for an efficient architecture or the use of a GPU for faster training.

**Note:**

While the code mentions plotting various metrics, it is not clear if these plots are generated and displayed as part of the training process or are separate operations.
