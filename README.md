## Inspiration
Inspired by the challenges faced by a group member while conducting research on AI at the University of Calgary, NeuroSync aims to solve a common problem he faced during his research.

## What it Does
NeuroSync simplifies tracking complex version histories for AI researchers. It not only organizes different experiment versions but also analyzes and summarizes version stats, making the research process more efficient.

## How We Built It
We harnessed the power of Python for a robust backend, integrating Flask with a sleek front end crafted from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Challenges We Encountered
We initially spent nearly 5 hours trying to build a GUI with Tkinter, an unfamiliar package, before pivoting to Flask for a more efficient solution.

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of
- Developed a fully functional prototype in just 18 hours with a two-person team.
- Gained competency in Flask integration on the fly.
- Created a solution addressing a real-life problem faced by our group member, enhancing productivity.
- Dedicated ourselves fully to a single project from conception to prototype.

## What We Learned
- Building full-stack applications is challenging, especially for a small team.
- Gained hands-on experience with Flask for seamless front-end and back-end integration.
- How to make a complete project from start to finish in one intense session.

## What’s Next for NeuroSync
We aim to refine the platform and add quality-of-life features to enhance user experience.
